    Welcome. On this page you can find my
    <%= link "software projects", to: page_path(@conn, :software) %>,

  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Christian Kruse. I work as a software developer and
    system administator at <%= link "Termitel GmbH", to: "https://termitel.de/" %>.
    I live in Germany in a small town called
    <%= link "Steinfurt", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinfurt" %>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about software development,
    <%= link "Linux", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" %>,
    <%= link "FLOSS", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" %>
    as well as <%= link "OS X", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X" %>.
    I am also a do-it-yourself apologetic: I did a lot of things in and
    around my house myself. I love the hacker culture. And last but not
    least I am a dog owner.

  <p>
    This is my personal replacement for Twitter, Facebook and the other
    data silos. <%= link "My content is mine", to: "http://indiewebcamp.com/" %>
    â€” so if you are interested in my activity, just have a look at this
    page.
