  <div class="p-note">
    <p>
      My name is Christian Kruse. I work as a software developer and
      system administator at <%= link "Termitel GmbH", to: "https://termitel.de/" %>.
      I live in Germany in a small town called
      <%= link "Steinfurt", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinfurt" %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am passionate about software development,
      <%= link "Linux", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" %>,
      <%= link "FLOSS", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" %>
      as well as <%= link "OS X", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X" %>.
      I am also a do-it-yourself apologetic: I did a lot of things in and
      around my house myself. I love the hacker culture. And last but not
      least I am a dog owner.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is my personal replacement for Twitter, Facebook and the other
      data silos. <%= link "My content is mine", to: "http://indiewebcamp.com/" %>
      â€” so if you are interested in my activity, just have a look at this
      page.

  <p>Please send me encrypted mails if possible (see my public key above). Every
    bit of encrypted traffic increases the encrypted background noise
    and thus makes it harder to distinguish between important and
    unimportant traffic.</p>
