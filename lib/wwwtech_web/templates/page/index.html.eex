      Welcome. On this page you can find my
      <%= link "software projects", to: Routes.page_path(@conn, :software) %>,
      my <%= link "articles", to: Routes.article_path(@conn, :index) %>,
      my <%= link "notes", to: Routes.note_path(@conn, :index) %> and my
      <%= link "pictures", to: Routes.picture_path(@conn, :index) %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My name is Christian Kruse. I work as a software developer and
      system administator at <%= link "Termitel GmbH", to: "https://termitel.de/" %>.
      I live in Germany in a small town called
      <%= link "Steinfurt", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinfurt" %>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am passionate about software development,
      <%= link "GNU/Linux", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" %>,
      <%= link "FLOSS", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" %>
      as well as <%= link "macOS", to: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macOS" %>.
      I am also a do-it-yourself apologetic: I did a lot of things in and
      around my house myself. I love the hacker culture. And last but not
      least I am a dog owner.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is my personal replacement for Twitter, Facebook and the other
      data silos. <%= link "My content is mine", to: "http://indiewebcamp.com/" %>
      â€” so if you are interested in my activity, just have a look at this
      page.
