<header class="page-header">
  <h2>More…</h2>
</header>

<p>Since I don't want to clutter the navigation bar with unimportant
  items I moved the less important things to this sub page.</p>

<p>For now there are only likes, but there is more to come.</p>

<h3>Likes</h3>

<p><%= link "Likes", to: Routes.like_path(@conn, :index) %> are things I found on the internet and somehow think they're cool. Like - things I like 😁</p>

<%= if logged_in?(@conn) do %>
  <p><%= link "Mentions", to: Routes.mention_path(@conn, :index) %></p>
<% end %>
